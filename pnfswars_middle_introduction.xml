  <t>
    Both Parallel Network File System (pNFS) and the File Layout Type
    were defined in the Network File System (NFS) version 4.1
    protocol specification, <xref target='RFC5661' />. The Block
    Layout Type was defined in <xref target='RFC5663' /> and the Object
    Layout Type was in turn defined in <xref target='RFC5664' />.
  </t>

  <t>
    Some implementors have interpretted the text in Sections 12
    ("Parallel NFS (pNFS)") and 13 ("NFSv4.1 as a Storage
    Protocol in pNFS: the File Layout Type") of <xref target='RFC5661' />
    as both being strictly for the File Layout Type. I.e., since
    Section 13 was not covered in a separate RFC like those for
    both the Block and Object Layout Types, there is some confusion
    as to the responsibilities of both the Metadata Server (MDS) and
    the Data Servers (DS).
  </t>

  <t>
    As a consequence, new internet drafts (see <xref target='FlexFiles' />
    and <xref target='Lustre' />) may not be meeting the requirements
    to be a pNFS Layout Type.

    <list style='hanging'>
      <t hangText='Data Server (DS):'>
        is one of the pNFS servers which provide the contents
        of a file system object which is a regular file. Depending
        on the layout, there might be one or more DSes over which
        the data is striped. Note that while the MDS is strictly
        accessed over the NFSv4.1 protocol, depending on the
        Layout Type, the DS could be accessed via any protocol
        that meets the pNFS requirements.
      </t>

      <t hangText='layout:'>
        is a description of how a file's data is organized on one
        or more storage devices.
      </t>

      <t hangText='layout stateid:'>
        is a 128-bit quantity returned by a server that
        uniquely defines the layout state provided by the server
        for a specific layout that describes a Layout Type and
        file (see Section 12.5.2 of <xref target='RFC5661' />).
        Further, Section 12.5.3 describes the difference between
        a layout stateid and a normal stateid.
      </t>

      <t hangText='Layout Type:'>
        describes both the storage protocol used to
        access the data and the aggregation scheme used to lays out
        the file data on the underlying storage devices.
      </t>

      <t hangText='metadata:'>
        is that part of the file system object which describes
        the object and not the payload. E.g., it could be the
        time since last modification, access, etc.
      </t>

      <t hangText='Metadata Server (MDS):'>
        is the pNFS server which provides metadata information
        for a file system object. It also is repsonsible for
        generating layouts for file system objects.
      </t>

      <t hangText='stateid:'>
        is a 128-bit quantity returned by a server that
        uniquely defines the open and locking states provided by the
        server for a specific open-owner or lock-owner/open-owner pair for
        a specific file and type of lock.
