<section anchor="sec:security" title="Security Considerations">

  <t>
    This section does not deal directly with security considerations
    for existing or new layout types.  Instead, it provides a general
    framework for understating security-related issues within the pNFS
    framework.  Specific security considerations will be addressed in the
    Security Considerations sections of documents specifying layout types.
  </t>

  <t>
    The layout type specification must ensure that only data accesses
    consistent with the NFSV4.1 security model are allowed.  It may do
    this directly, by providing that appropriate checks be performed
    at the time each access is performed. It may do it indirectly by
    allowing the client or the storage device to be responsible for
    making the appropriate checks.  In the latter case, I/O access writes
    are reflected in layouts and the layout type must provide a way to
    prevent inappropriate access due to permissions changes between the
    time a layout is granted and the time the access is performed.
  </t>

  <t>
    The metadata server MUST be able to fence off a client's access
    to the data file on a storage device. When it revokes the layout,
    the client's access MUST be terminated at the storage devices.
    The client has a subsequent opportunity to re-acquire the layout and
    perform the security check in the context of the newly current
    access permissions.
