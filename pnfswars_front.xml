      <t>
        This document defines the requirements which individual pNFS
        layout types need to meet in order to work within the parallel NFS
        (pNFS) framework as defined in RFC5661.  In so doing, it aims to
        more clearly distinguish between requirements for pNFS as a whole
        and those those specifically directed to the pNFS File Layout.
        The lack of a clear separation between the two set of
        requirements has been troublesome for those specifying and
        evaluating new Layout Types.  In this regard, this
        document effectively updates RFC5661.
