    In the three published Layout Types, the burden of enforcing
    the security of NFSv4.1 can fall to either the storage devices
    (Files), the client (Blocks), or the metadata server (Objects).
    Such decisions seem to be forced by the native capabilities of
    the storage devices - if a real control protocol can be implemented,
    then the burden can be shifted primarily to the storage devices.

    But as we have seen, the control protocol is actually a set of
    requirements. And as new Layout Types are published, the enclosing
    documents minimally MUST address:

    <list style='format (%d)'>
      <t>
        The fencing of clients after a layout is revoked.
      </t>

      <t>
        The security implications of the native capabilities of the
        storage devices with respect to the requirements of the
        NFSv4.1 security model.
