  <t>
    In the three published layout types, the burden of enforcing
    the security of NFSv4.1 can fall to either the storage devices
    (files), the client (blocks), or the metadata server (objects).
    Such choices are conditioned by the native capabilities of
    the storage devices - if a control protocol can be implemented,
    then the burden can be shifted primarily to the storage devices.
  </t>

  <t>

    In the context of this document, we treat the control protocol as
    a set of requirements.  And as new layout types are published,
    the defining documents MUST address:

    <list style='format (%d)'>
      <t>
        The fencing of clients after a layout is revoked.
      </t>

      <t>
        The security implications of the native capabilities of the
        storage devices with respect to the requirements of the
        NFSv4.1 security model.
      </t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t>
    In addition, these defining  documents need to make clear how other
    semantic requirements of NFSv4.1 (e.g., locking) are met in the
    context of the proposed layout type.
